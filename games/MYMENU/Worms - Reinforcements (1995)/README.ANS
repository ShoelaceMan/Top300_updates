Worms United is a compilation that includes the turn-based strategy game Worms and its add-on pack Worms: Reinforcements.

Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around.

Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends.

Worms: Reinforcements is an add-on to Worms. It includes some modifications to the gameplay, such as the ability to choose the worm the player wants to to use each turn, as well as additional levels and multiplayer support. It also allows the creation and the use of custom levels and speech packs.
