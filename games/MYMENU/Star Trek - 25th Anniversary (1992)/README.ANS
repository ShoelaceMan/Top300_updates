Released in the glory days of graphic adventures and to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of Star Trek, Star Trek: 25th Anniversary was an MS-DOS based game that brought the World of Kirk, Spock, McCoy and co. into the then modern age of computer gaming with 256 color VGA graphics and digitized sound for the first time in a Star Trek game.  Utilizing Interplay's own version of the tried and tested point and click adventure system, Star Trek: 25th Anniversary was a combination of a point-and-click adventure game and a starship simulator. At release the game proved to be a moderate success both financially and critically. A sequel, Star Trek: Judgment Rites, was released a few years later. The game was developed and published by Interplay.
