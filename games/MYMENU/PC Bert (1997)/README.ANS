Quite a late, but high-quality clone of the classic arcade game Q*bert , released back in 1982. The goal of this game is similar to the original and is to change the color of all the steps of the pyramid. This is done by jumping on them. Completely repaint the pyramid in the desired color, go to the next level. Enemies will hinder us in every way and try to kill us. But there are also useful bonuses that can facilitate our mission.
