Screamer is a traditional arcade racing game. You can drive lots of different top cars, like a Corvette or a Porsche 911. The game has very different tracks, all well-designed with attention to detail and locale. Additionally, all tracks are available in backwards mode. If you think you're the best of the best, you can take on the Bullet car for the ultimate championship race.

The graphics engine was very good for its time, providing extremely fast texture-mapped graphics on a 486.
