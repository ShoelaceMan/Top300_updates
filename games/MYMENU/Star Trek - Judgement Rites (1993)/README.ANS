Sequel to the award-winning Star Trek: 25th Anniversary, Judgment Rites brings back the entire Enterprise crew in 8 all new episodes. Strange things are happening in distant space, such as dead planets spawning life and WW1 planes in outer space. You need to survive these situations.

You must navigate your way through space, and send away teams onto planets to investigate situations, communicate with other characters and solve puzzles. Unlike the previous game, action sequences are optional.

Note: Includes the Cinematic Movie & Sounds Expansion.
