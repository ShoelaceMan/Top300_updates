Magic Carpet is a first-person perspective game, in which you are a mage who flies on a, well, magic carpet and casts spells. The game has 50 levels, called "worlds"; each of those is set in a sea terrain with several mountainous islands. Your goal on each level is to amass enough mana within your castle to "restore the equilibrium" within the world. Once this happens, you can head to the next level.

To collect mana, you have to find it (it is represented by golden spheres) and cast a specific spell to make it "yours". To collect this mana, you have to use a special spell to raise a castle of your own out of the ground. A balloon will appear over the newly created castle; it will proceed to fly around the level and collect "your" mana. Initially, your castle will be small and won't be able to hold much mana, so you'll have to keep casting the "castle" spell at it to make it bigger.

Magic Carpet Plus includes the add-on content, Hidden Worlds. It features tougher missions and computer opponents in new landscapes with new spells...

Note: There are known bugs on level 13 and level 35 due to the games limit on spawning. If you are unable to cast spells, it is because the creature population has reached the point where no more objects may spawn. Work arounds include not using high res mode, and killing off archers as soon as possible. More info can be found by googling the issue.
