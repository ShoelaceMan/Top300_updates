A DOS platformer with only 5 levels.

The graphics and the gameplay are good. It's only a pity that there only are 5 levels.

The controls are very strange too:
- in menu:
Arrow keys + "A" or "S"
- in game:
Left/right arrow = move
Up arrow = look up / enter a pipe above Mario
Down arrow = duck / enter a pipe
S = jump
D = special jump (longer jump)
Esc = give up and back to main menu
Alt-X = exit game
