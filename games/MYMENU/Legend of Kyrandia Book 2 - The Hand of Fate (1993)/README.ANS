The legend continues. In first part of this trilogy, you were Brandon, soon to be a king, and only heir to the throne determined to stop the evil jester - Malcolm. Now, you're playing Zanthia, the young sorceress. Kyrandia is dissapearing. The high council found the cure for that - the anchor from the center of the world. When you come to that anchor, you'll see that this is not the answer. Marco's Hand is behind that sabotage (Marco is your friend, clumsy but with nice attentions. Hand is a big hand that isn't that nice as you think). Now, you must save Kyrandia before everything else vanishes without a trace.
